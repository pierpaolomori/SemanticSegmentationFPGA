# Accelerating and Pruning CNNs for Semantic Segmentation on FPGA

---

[//]: # (###This repo is a demo of DAC 2022 paper: )

Semantic segmentation is one of the popular tasks in computer vision, providing pixel-wise annotations for scene understanding.
However, segmentation-based convolutional neural networks require tremendous computational power. 
We introduced a fully pipelined FPGA hardware accelerator (based on <cite>[PipeCNN][1]</cite>) with support for dilated convolution, which cuts down the redundant zero multiplications. 
Furthermore, we propose a genetic algorithm based automated channel pruning technique to jointly optimize computational complexity and model accuracy. 
Finally, hardware heuristics and an accurate model of the custom accelerator design enable a hardware-aware pruning framework. 
We achieve 2.44× lower latency with minimal degradation in semantic prediction quality (−1.98 pp lower mean intersection over union) compared to the
baseline DeepLabV3+ model, evaluated on an Arria-10 FPGA.
